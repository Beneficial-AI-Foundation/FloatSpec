Here’s a tighter, more deterministic version you can drop in as a system/task prompt.

# Always Works™ Prompt

## Task

Fix proofs / theorems in `FloatSpec/src/Core/__PLACEHOLDER__`.

## Goal

Repair **exactly one** item: the **first** theorem in the target file that lacks a full proof (due to `sorry`, errors, or unsolved goals). Priority: errors > sorry. Deliver a clean `lake build` with **no new breakages** introduced.

---

## Selection Rule (deterministic)

1. Run `lake build` and capture logs.
2. Search for all `error` inside the log file. If the build reports any **error** inside the target file, choose the error with the **smallest line number**; the associated theorem is your target.
3. Otherwise, search the file for the first `sorry` (by line number).

   * If that `sorry` is **inside a `def`/function body**, locate the original Coq source in `/home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core`, port the definition to Lean 4, and then prove the corresponding theorems. Do not use `pure true` or any placeholder in the definition.
4. If there is **no** error and **no** `sorry` in the file, go through the file to examine non-`sorry` placeholder in the definition of functions or specs, including `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and its variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`. If you find any of these placeholders, locate the original Coq source in `/home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core`, port the definition to Lean 4 to replace original placeholder, and then prove the corresponding theorems.
5. If none of the previous case are detected, write a short report explaining what you checked and **stop**.

> “First” always means **smallest line number** in the target file.

---

## Prerequisites (read first)

* `FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md` (overall pipeline)
* `./CLAUDE.md` (proof-writing conventions and `mvcgen` info)

---

## Process (ONE-BY-ONE, compile after each step)

1. **Identify target** using the Selection Rule and record the exact line number and reason (error/sorry/unsolved goals).
2. **Understand spec & code**

   * Verify the definition body (if relevant) matches intent and source (Coq).
   * Review the local spec/Hoare triples and nearby lemmas.
3. **Plan**: decide whether to prove directly or factor helper lemmas (preferred for long proofs).
4. **Draft Implement**

   * Add minimal helper lemmas (use `private` or local `namespace`).
   * Follow house style; use `Zaux.lean`’s `Zfast_div_eucl_spec` and in-file patterns as templates.
   * Do not attempt to skip or bypass the proof: `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, or any non-`sorry` placeholder (including `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and all variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`) are strictly forbidden.
5. **Check Implement**: review your changes to ensure no forbidden placeholders were introduced. To be specific:
    * Search the diff for `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and all variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`.
    * If you find any of these placeholders, revert all the related changes and work from beginning.
    * If the search did not find any of these placeholders, apply the patch and proceed to the next step.
6. **Compile**: `lake build` immediately after the change.

   * Fix all reported errors before making more changes.
7. **Polish**: refactor only if it **reduces** proof fragility and aligns with the Coq source.
8. **Log**: update the change log (see “Change Log & Reporting”).

> Never batch multiple risky edits. Build early, build often.

---

## Allowed vs. Prohibited Changes

**Allowed (with restraint)**

* Introduce small, well-named helper lemmas.
* Reorder theorems **only** to resolve clear dependency cycles—and log it.
* Minimal spec tweaks **only if** the Coq original demands it (see below).

**Prohibited**

* Deleting any existing theorems/functions.
* Using `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, or any non-`sorry` placeholder, including `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, and all variants which could be easily deducted to a `True`. If you see such placeholders, replace them with `sorry` instead.
* Expanding scope beyond the **single selected** target.
* Broad spec rewrites or syntax changes to Hoare triples (unless strictly required by the Coq source and documented).

---

## If the Theorem/Spec Seems Wrong

1. Compare with the original Coq statement/proof in `/home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core`.
2. If a mismatch **blocks** the Lean proof:

   * Update the Lean statement **minimally** to match the Coq intent.
   * Port the relevant argument/structure from Coq.
   * **Record every change** in the change log with justification and Coq references.

---

## Proof Strategy Guidelines

* Prefer decomposition: prove small lemmas, then assemble.
* Use existing proven lemmas from imports and `mathlib4` where available; if uncertain, search first, otherwise implement locally.
* Keep terms and rewriting explicit; avoid fragile tactic scripts.
* Preserve existing notation and Hoare triple syntax whenever possible.

---

## Compilation & Completion Criteria

* After **every** change: run `lake build` (capture logs).
* **Definition of Complete** for this task:

  * The selected target theorem is fully proven (no `sorry`, no `axiom` or other placeholders, no unsolved goals).
  * The repository compiles cleanly (errors = 0).
  * No unrelated theorems were altered, deleted, or broken.
* Warnings may remain; do **not** chase them unless they block the proof.

---

## Change Log & Reporting (mandatory)

Append an entry to a markdown file (e.g., `docs/FloatSpec-ProofChanges.md`) with:

```
## File: FloatSpec/src/Core/__PLACEHOLDER__
- Target: <theorem/def name> at line <n>
- Reason picked: <error|sorry|unsolved goals>
- Approach: <direct proof | helper lemmas (list) | ported from Coq (list)>
- Changes:
  - [ ] Definition modified? (yes/no). If yes, minimal diff + reason.
  - [ ] Spec modified? (yes/no). If yes, minimal diff + Coq reference path.
  - [ ] Reordering done? (yes/no). If yes, explain dependency.
- Coq reference(s): /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core/<file>.v : <lines/lemma names>
- Build: <command used> | <log file path>
- Notes: pitfalls, invariants, future useful lemmas (if any)
```

If the file had no target (no errors, no `sorry`), write a brief “No-action report”.

---

## Practical Tips

* Save build output to a log and search it instead of scrolling:

  * Example: `lake build 2>&1 | tee .log/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_build.log`
* When adding lemmas, colocate near the target or in a `private` section to avoid polluting the API.
* If a `def` is `sorry` and the function is hard to realize: inline the needed facts into the theorem (as in the Coq proof), **clear** the `def`’s `sorry` via a correct implementation or restructure to avoid relying on a bogus placeholder—then prove the theorem.
* Look for definition in the imports and opens before actually implementing it. If the definition is already in the imports or opens, just use it directly and aviod duplicate definition.
* Change order within file is permitted only to resolve dependency cycles. If you do reorder, document it. If the dependency you need is in another file, check if the import will cause a dependency cycle; if so, do not reorder and check the coq original source and use the proof Strategy from there.

---

## Recap Checklist (ALL must be checked and achieved before you stop)

* [ ] Applied Selection Rule; recorded line+reason.
* [ ] Read PIPELINE/CLAUDE docs.
* [ ] Implemented proof (or minimal Coq-aligned spec tweak).
* [ ] No `axiom`/`admit`/`pure true`; no new `sorry`. Check by searching the diff to make sure you did not introduce any of these. If you did introduce any of these, revert all the related changes and work from beginning.
* [ ] `lake build` succeeds without error.
* [ ] Change log entry added with Coq references.

**Be persistent.** If you can’t close the main target within this session, leave behind **useful, compiling helper lemmas** that clearly reduce the remaining gap—and document them in the change log.

Context Provided by Orchestrator:
- Target file: FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_generic.lean
- Selection: { line_number: 66, reason: sorry }
- Target identifier: spacing_bound
- Coq reference root: /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core
- Full fixer prompt path: /home/hantao/code/FloatSpec/scripts/full_prompt.md
- Guidance: Avoid import cycles. Do NOT import Ulp.lean here (Ulp imports Round_generic). Prefer local helper lemmas (mark them `private`) and use only imports already present in Round_generic.lean.
- Suggested sketch: Case on F x. If F x, use Rnd_DN_pt/Rnd_UP_pt definitions to prove xdn = x = xup; gap is 0. Otherwise, use existence+uniqueness of DN/UP points and the scaled-mantissa/cexp machinery to bound the gap by (beta : ℝ)^(cexp x). Keep changes minimal.

Policy Summary (enforced):
- Only fix the single selected item (`spacing_bound`) and minimal local helpers.
- Forbidden: axiom, admit, `pure true`, `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, or trivially-true variants; no new `sorry`.
- No deleting existing items; no broad rewrites; spec changes only if strictly necessary and documented with Coq references.
- Build must succeed with 0 errors after the patch.

Required Outputs:
1) A unified diff patch (or full edited file content) touching only the target item and minimal local helpers.
2) A brief proof approach summary.
3) A compile note (if you compiled locally).
4) A Change Log entry block filled for this change.

**Evaluating file lines and definitions**

The file I’m working with is quite long, but my focus is on the `spacing_bound` defined at line 66, as pointed out by the orchestrator. I've noticed it appears earlier in the file, and now I need to implement that theorem while making sure not to import `Ulp`. I should use local lemmas and existing ones. I’ll also look for definitions of `Rnd_DN_pt` and `Rnd_UP_pt` in `FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_pred`, so opening that file will help clarify things.

**Exploring lemmas in Generic_fmt**

I'm looking into the various lemmas available in Generic_fmt, like zpow and mag. It seems there could be interesting results related to spacing as well. I think a good next step would be to search specifically for the spacing lemma to see what I can find. It’s always good to gather more information on these aspects! Let’s see what results come up.

**Exploring theorems in a document**

I'm noticing that the round generic area shows many theorems. There are lines around 2987 that refer to Rnd_DN_pt/UP. I think it would be worth opening that section to see if there's already a spacing bound lemma implemented. It could save me some time in figuring this out! So, I'll take a closer look there and see what I can find.

**Considering file length and structure**

This file is quite extensive, containing numerous theorems that showcase various properties. I see that the spacing_bound is mentioned at the top, but it seems a bit scattered. I'm also noting that later sections may include related lemmas which could be useful. I should probably search for mentions of the spacing bound in the later lines, as I might find some duplicates or relevant information there.

**Evaluating beta assumptions**

I’m considering whether Valid_exp implies that beta is greater than 1. Checking the Valid_exp class, it seems it only relies on the fexp property and doesn’t mention beta. There’s a concern about positivity for mathematical operations that require it. The inequality "xup - xdn ≤ β^c" could hold even if beta is 1 or less. However, previous theorems did assume 1 < beta, and I wonder if that was an oversight. I might need to adjust preconditions carefully.
**Analyzing proof suggestions**

I'm reviewing the proof suggestions and considering the case on F x. If F x holds, I can use definitions like Rnd_DN_pt and Rnd_UP_pt to show that xdn equals x, and consequently, that the gap is zero. If F x doesn’t hold, I should apply the existence and uniqueness of DN and UP points, leveraging scaled-mantissa and cexp machinery to bound the gap. I don't want to require 1 < beta, but I need precise bounds on xup - xdn, ideally something like gap ≤ β^c, rather than 2 times that.
**Exploring mantissa properties**

I’m considering using a scaled mantissa approach where s equals x times β to the power of -c, and defining k as the floor of s when xdn is less than or equal to x. However, I realize that xdn might not correspond directly to that floor since generic_format uses a truncated mantissa relative to y's cexp instead of x's. This could complicate things. It looks like I need to check for existing lemmas regarding the difference between two representables. My searches for "xup - xdn" and "gap" haven't been fruitful, and searching "round_ge_generic" turned out to be unhelpful.
**Investigating generic format properties**

I'm searching for "generic_format_opp," which I previously used, to see if there are lemmas related to canonical exponent monotonicity, like "lt_cexp_pos_ax." I wonder if that's even necessary. It seems there might be a simpler proof: if F is generic_format, then the smallest step near x is β^(cexp x). I need to look closely at the definition; the generic_format function shows it computes x using Ztrunc combined with the mantissa and β raised to cexp x. This indicates that for F y, y equals Ztrunc(y times β to the power of -cexp y).
**Clarifying generic format for bounds**

I’ve realized that generic_format processes y directly, using cexp evaluated on y, not an external x. For any y in F, we have y equal to q(y) times β raised to cexp y, with q(y) being the integer part of the scaled mantissa. This means that both xdn and xup are representable at their own canonical exponents. I want to bound xup - xdn to be less than or equal to β^c, where c equals cexp x. I should check for existing lemmas like "cexp_DN" to support this.

**Analyzing bounds and representability**

I need to ensure x minus xdn is less than or equal to β^c, and similarly for xup minus x. When I sum those, they should not exceed 2β^c, but the total needs to remain within β^c. This means each difference can be a maximum of (1/2)β^c if x isn't representable, or zero if it is. I’m considering whether the grid is uniform; indeed, numbers in F take the form of n * β^{fexp(m)}, where m is the magnitude.
**Exploring step sizes and bounds**

I’m considering how the step size may vary with the magnitude region. Close to x, any y within the bounding bracket must have a canonical exponent equal to fexp(mag x). There’s a lemma in Round_generic related to round_to_generic. Also, for bracketing points, there's another lemma stating that if d is less than u, any f in F means f must be either less than or equal to d or greater than or equal to u. Now, if u minus d is greater than β^c, we could find a representable number in between, but it may not necessarily be in F.
**Ensuring representability in generic format**

I need to confirm that y is in F, which means the generic_format gives y as a truncated mantissa times β raised to the cexp of y. However, there's no lemma showing that adding β^c to a representable number results in another representable number in F. In a uniform grid with a fixed exponent c, numbers of the form nβ^c for integers n are representable, but only if their canonical exponent equals fexp(mag(y)). If y crosses a magnitude boundary, then cexp y might change, but within a certain exponent range where the magnitude is less than β^{e}, cexp equals fexp.
**Assessing representability and grid coverage**

I’m realizing that the grid may not encompass all numbers in the form nβ^c. The generic_format defines representability through cexp(y), where y is representable if there's an integer, "truncated," equal to the Ztrunc scaled mantissa of y. This condition holds true since Ztrunc always returns an integer. However, the equation y equals truncated times β^{cexp(y)} is only valid for y whose scaled mantissa matches its truncation. Thus, I can't confirm that y = d + β^c is in F. I need to check for a lemma regarding the spacing between representable numbers near x.

**Exploring step sizes and bounds**

I’m considering how the step size may vary with the magnitude region. Close to x, any y within the bounding bracket must have a canonical exponent equal to fexp(mag x). There’s a lemma in Round_generic related to round_to_generic. Also, for bracketing points, there's another lemma stating that if d is less than u, any f in F means f must be either less than or equal to d or greater than or equal to u. Now, if u minus d is greater than β^c, we could find a representable number in between, but it may not necessarily be in F.

**Ensuring representability in generic format**

I need to confirm that y is in F, which means the generic_format gives y as a truncated mantissa times β raised to the cexp of y. However, there's no lemma showing that adding β^c to a representable number results in another representable number in F. In a uniform grid with a fixed exponent c, numbers of the form nβ^c for integers n are representable, but only if their canonical exponent equals fexp(mag(y)). If y crosses a magnitude boundary, then cexp y might change, but within a certain exponent range where the magnitude is less than β^{e}, cexp equals fexp.

**Assessing representability and grid coverage**

I’m realizing that the grid may not encompass all numbers in the form nβ^c. The generic_format defines representability through cexp(y), where y is representable if there's an integer, "truncated," equal to the Ztrunc scaled mantissa of y. This condition holds true since Ztrunc always returns an integer. However, the equation y equals truncated times β^{cexp(y)} is only valid for y whose scaled mantissa matches its truncation. Thus, I can't confirm that y = d + β^c is in F. I need to check for a lemma regarding the spacing between representable numbers near x.

**Exploring bounding concepts**

I’ve defined ulp_prelim as β^(cexp x), which is good. Now, I need to check spacing_bound; it bounds u-d ≤ ulp_prelim x. This might hint at a spacing lemma called "Znearest region width," but I'm not quite sure. So, I should look into Generic_fmt to find any lemmas that detail how to bound the difference between two representable numbers using "cexp x". There seems to be something interesting here!

**Analyzing mathematical conditions**

I'm looking into the definition of monoids, which might include negative bases. However, the positivity of power monotonicities isn't available, which complicates matters. It's pretty standard that in these formalizations, they assume that beta is greater than 1. Many theorems have this precondition, so I'm considering adding the assumption of "1 < beta" to spacing_bound. But I need to check how "cexp beta fexp" and scaled_mantissa are implemented, while also being mindful of lemmas that require "beta > 1".
**Considering assumptions on beta**

I need to determine the sign of β^(-c). It's positive if β is not zero and the exponent is an integer. However, for a negative base, the results depend on whether the exponent is even or odd, which complicates things since we can’t rely on positivity without the assumption of 1 < beta. Previous definitions often assume "lt_trans Int.zero_lt_one hβ," using 1 < beta for positivity. It's probable that spacing_bound should also assume this. Yet, modifying the theorem signature isn’t straightforward without justification.
**Exploring inequalities with beta**

I'm considering the possibility of proving a weaker statement for all integer bases by using absolute values to bypass the sign issue. The target inequality involves "(beta : ℝ) ^ (cexp ...)", which can be negative if positivity isn’t assumed. In this case, having the left-hand side (LHS) being greater than or equal to zero conflicts with a negative right-hand side (RHS). Thus, for the inequality to hold, the RHS must be nonnegative. Therefore, I conclude that the theorem can’t be proven without assuming 1 < beta or at least that (beta : ℝ) is greater than or equal to 1.
**Reviewing the theorem's assumptions**

I think the current form of the theorem might be a stub because it has a "sorry" placeholder that accepted compilation before. To complete the proof, I need to add the assumption of 1 < beta, which has been used in many earlier theorems. This means I only need a minimal specification tweak: adding "1 < beta" to the premises. The original Flocq seems to assume a base greater than 1, so I need to check the Coq original for spacing bound in Generic_fmt.v, but I can only search locally at /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core.

**Evaluating spacing lemmas**

The Coq reference points to gap lemmas found in Ulp.v or Round_NE.v, mentioning "round_UP_DN_ulp." However, this may not directly relate to rounding differences equating to ulp. I think spacing_bound can link to "round_UP_minus_DN_le_ulp" under specific conditions. Since we can't import Ulp.lean due to orchestral restrictions, I'll rely on earlier lemmas to replicate necessary logic. I’ll implement spacing_bound simply, using specific interval boundaries for bounding x based on the scaled mantissa.
**Defining integers in generic format**

In my exploration, I've defined integers n and p as the floor and ceiling of s, respectively. Then, I consider d' and u' defined as n * β^c and p * β^c. I'm questioning whether d' and u' fall within the generic format's definition. For a value y to be in this format, it needs to equal Ztrunc(y * β^{-cexp y}) times β^(cexp y). If y takes the form n * β^c, then cexp y relates to fexp (mag y), but I'm uncertain about the implications. I think if n is small enough, it might maintain c, but it’s not guaranteed.
**Using bracketing points effectively**

I'm considering how to utilize xdn and xup as bracketing points that maximize and minimize representables in relation to x. We don’t have to show d' and u' are representable; instead, I can demonstrate that there's a representable number y within F such that y ≤ x and x - y ≤ β^c. I'll do something similar for y' ≥ x. The critical point is that we already know xdn and xup exist. I think we can derive bounds by looking at scaled_mantissa properties related to x. This leads me to consider s as the scaled mantissa of x, and then what t_dn would be in relation to that.
**Examining representable numbers**

I'm thinking about how for any y in F, if y ≤ x, then t = y * β^{-c} should be less than or equal to floor(s) when s is non-negative. But wait, I'm unsure if floor(s) is always integral or if t might not be integral as well. I want to show that s - t ≤ 1, which seems tricky since I'm not sure if there's a y' in between. For integers k, I believe k * β^c is an F number, but I'm questioning that. I think the "generic_format_bpow" lemma indicates that certain constraints apply for representability. I’ll search for the generic_format_F2R lemma for clearer insight into this.

**Examining bounds with beta**

I'm trying to show that z - y ≤ 1, which means bounding the scaled difference. Given xdn ≤ x ≤ xup, we have y ≤ s ≤ z if β^(-c) is non-negative. This leads me to conclude that for positive β, it needs to be greater than 1 to ensure monotonicity.

Assuming 1 < beta, I can deduce that y is less than or equal to s and s is less than or equal to z. I'll use the property that "no representable numbers between xdn and xup" to solidify that z - y ≤ 1, even though y and z might not be integers. Using the structural property of F within unit intervals in scaled-mantissa space, I can argue there’s at most one value of F in any such interval.
**Analyzing scaled values**

I need to consider the property where if v and w are in F, and cexp x = c, then scaled values v*β^{-c} and w*β^{-c} differ by an integer. It seems they must actually be integers because the scaled mantissa of a representable number y with a canonical exponent e results in z_y = y * β^{-e}, which is an integer. However, if the relative exponent c doesn’t equal e, they won’t necessarily differ by integers. It appears I can't salvage this without more supporting facts, so I'll search in Round_generic for relevant lemmas that could help.

**Revisiting bounding theorem**

I need to prove that both xup and xdn lie within the interval defined by β^{e-1} and β^e. I’m considering restricting to the region where x > 0, even though the theorem doesn’t limit signs. Perhaps handling both signs using absolute values could work. Given that xdn ≤ x ≤ xup, the difference xup - xdn should be ≤ |x| + |x| + something, but that's not enriching. It seems adjusting the theorem to assume 1 < beta is my best option, focusing on the scaled mantissa difference.
**Clarifying mantissa derivation**

I’m considering whether round_to_generic’s truncation could work with earlier lemmas like "mantissa_DN_small_pos" and "DN/UP small pos," which apply to a small region and specific DN rounding, not a generic case. I think I could use the generic_format for xdn and xup to determine their scaled mantissas when their exponents are integers. If cd is the exponent for xdn and cu for xup, then xdn = md * β^{cd} and xup = mu * β^{cu}. Since xdn ≤ x ≤ xup and no F exists in between, it suggests cd must equal cu, or else there’s a contradiction.
**Navigating proof constraints**

Considering the time constraints, the implementers might have expected a simpler proof. If F x holds, it's trivial, but if not, I can't finalize a general proof. I think I could offer a vacuous bound with xup - xdn ≤ abs xup + abs xdn, which isn't equal to β^c. I realize I must deliver a patch that compiles without relying on heavy reasoning or terms like "axiom" or "admit." I can reference known lemmas to derive the inequality, particularly looking back at "mag_round" and "cexp_round_ge_ax." However, I need to prepare a plan without changing existing ones. Spacing_bound might just require "Generic_fmt.generic_format" and properties from "Raux" without being too complex. I'm curious if "generic_format_satisfies_any" could help here.
**Bounding values with F**

I’ve established that F contains 0 consistently, which gives me xdn ≤ x ≤ xup. However, I need to bound u - d by β^cexp x. I'll attempt to find an upper bound using "mag" of x, where I know xup ≤ β^(mag x + 1) and xdn ≥ -β^(mag x + 1), but this doesn’t seem helpful. I should check "Ulp.lean" to understand how they proved spacing, though I can’t import it directly. Maybe I can replicate a specific lemma from that file or borrow a local helper lemma.

**Evaluating bounds in math**

I'm looking at the relationship between the ceiling and floor of a real number \( s \), noting that the difference is either 0 or 1. To establish our bounds, if I can show that \( y \) is less than or equal to \( \text{floor}(s) \) and \( z \) is greater than or equal to \( \text{ceil}(s) \), I can derive important inequalities. However, I realize I need to clarify whether \( y \) is greater than or equal to \( \text{floor}(s) \), leading to some confusion.
**Exploring integer relationships**

I'm considering different bounds for \( s \). I can set \( y \) and \( z \) based on the inequalities \( y \leq s < y + 1 \) and \( z - 1 < s \leq z \), but I'm not sure if they work. 

Choosing \( y' \) as the largest element in a specific set could help, but things get tricky with integer properties. The relationships between scaled values and their integers are complicated, especially regarding \( \text{floor}(s) \). I want to explore formulas like \( \text{Rnd\_DN\_pt} \) and \( \text{Rnd\_UP\_pt} \) to clarify these relationships.
**Proving representability in bounds**

I’m trying to establish that if both \( (cexp \, xdn).run = c \) and \( (cexp \, xup).run = c \), then both \( xdn \) and \( xup \) can be represented as \( md \cdot \beta^c \) and \( mu \cdot \beta^c \) with integers \( md \) and \( mu \). So, if \( s \) lies between them, \( mu \) must equal \( md \) or \( md + 1 \). I want to prove that \( mu - md \leq 1 \) overall. It seems plausible to explore lemmas related to cexp in my round_generic research, but I notice some areas still need solving, like "cexp_le" and "lt_cexp_pos_ax."
**Attempting to prove equality**

I'm working on proving the relationships involving \( xdn \) and \( xup \). I see that since \( xdn \leq x \) and \( xdn \) is in \( F \) with an integer representation \( md \), it's possible that \( cexp(xdn) \) is less than or equal to \( cexp(x) \). Likewise, since \( x \leq xup \) and \( xup \) is also in \( F \), \( cexp(x) \) might be less than or equal to \( cexp(xup) \). I could try to prove equality by considering maximality and minimality principles. If \( cexp(xdn) \) is less than \( c \), adding \( \beta^{cexp(xdn)} \) would yield a representable number in \( F \) between \( xdn \) and \( x \), conflicting with the maximality of \( xdn \). I need to reference the lemma in Ulp.lean about adding \( \text{ulp}(x) \) since it states that \( x + \text{ulp}(x) \in F \), which is exactly the result I need.
**Navigating representation in Ulp.lean**

I'm realizing that I can't import Ulp.lean here, which complicates things. Still, I noticed that \( \text{generic\_format\_plus\_ulp} \) uses \( \text{ulp} \). If I focus on the "equal exponents" case, I can argue that if \( xdn \in F \), then \( xdn + \beta^{(cexp \, xdn)} \) should also be in \( F \). However, this isn't necessarily the same as \( \text{generic\_format} \). The way I represent \( y \) needs careful attention, especially concerning canonical exponents. I should check for lemmas in \( \text{Generic\_fmt} \) that discuss the representation of consecutive floats.

**Evaluating proof approach**

I’m considering the "spacing_bound" proof and wondering if it’s really meant to be straightforward. It involves applying previous lemmas, but they have specific conditions. Theorems reference parameters, but they don’t seem to help much. I’m also thinking about rewriting the statement incorrectly into a trivial inequality. If I choose a large enough cexp, it could hold. Plus, the gap seems manageable within the confines of what I’m exploring. It’s a bit puzzling but intriguing!
**Exploring general inequality**

I'm considering a weak general inequality where xup - xdn could be bounded in relation to |xup| and |xdn|. I think that could lead to something like 2|x|. There's also a lemma that states |x| is less than or equal to β raised to mag x, but I wonder if mag x is greater than cexp x. I need to remember that cexp is derived from fexp applied to mag. However, I realize I can't make the necessary connections to salvage the argument. It's a bit frustrating!
**Proving the theorem**

I believe the best way forward is to prove the theorem by assuming "1 < beta." Without this assumption, it feels unprovable. So, I'll add that to the premise list. Next, I plan to show that xdn is less than or equal to the floor of the scaled mantissa multiplied by β raised to c. I’ll then show that xup is greater than or equal to the ceiling of the scaled mantissa multiplied by β raised to c. If both inequalities are satisfied, I can prove the result!
**Establishing representable numbers**

I need to demonstrate that the numbers d' and u', defined earlier, are representable in F and satisfy the bracket property. By their maximality and minimality, they must be less than or equal to xdn and xup, respectively. For d', I need it to be in F and less than or equal to x. Since xdn is the maximum for F, it follows that d' must be less than or equal to xdn. Similarly, u' should be in F and greater than or equal to xup. If I can prove that d' and u' are in F, I think I’ll be done!
**Analyzing representability and bounds**

I'm trying to compute cexp of y = m * β^c. I know cexp ≤ c holds if y ≠ 0 implies fexp(mag y) ≤ c. It’s tricky since mag y depends on |m|, but I only need to show that fexp(mag y) is less than or equal to c. I’m considering the representation of numbers and thinking about small regimes versus larger ones. There's a lot of back and forth as I wonder if I can implement theorems or if I need different approaches. I feel a bit stuck!
**Navigating the spacing bound proof**

I'm realizing that proving "spacing_bound" might be simpler than I initially thought by rewriting the inequalities. I need to state the assumption "1 < beta" to make progress. If I can show that F x holds, then both xdn and xup relate to x through definitions, making them equal. I’ll also try to establish that there exists a y in F, with y ≤ x and the gap between them being less than or equal to β^c. It’s a bit confusing, but I’ll consider using truncation methods for positive and negative values to establish my bounds better. I feel stuck on ensuring everything aligns correctly!
**Examining the spacing bound approach**

I'm trying to clarify the proof for spacing_bound involving y = n * β^c. For y to fit in the generic format, I need to explore how cexp relates to it. Since my established inequalities aren't helping much, I want to shift my focus to some simpler cases under the assumption "1 < beta." The plan indicates I need to either demonstrate equality when F x holds or establish bounds when it does not. Given all the complexities, the simplest path might be to use prior lemmas, even if some are marked as "sorry." I’m feeling like I need to find a solid angle to push this forward!
**Understanding spacing bounds**

I realize I’m trying to prove that 0 is less than or equal to something involving β to the power of c. To ensure that, having the assumption "1 < beta" is crucial. For cases where x isn't in F, it feels complex, and I’m considering whether to propose deferring that part of the proof for now. 

I’m thinking I should check for a simpler approach, especially if there's a direct link to "scaled_mantissa" properties. I suspect the spacing theorem was intended to relate closely to rounding definitions. If I can find existing lemmas regarding these bounds, it could help streamline my proof!

**Analyzing absolute value inequalities**

I need to establish positivity to assert equality of absolute values to their non-negative versions. I'll focus on the property of less than or equal to (≤). For example, "abs (f - x) ≤ 1/2 β^c" leads to inequalities like x - f ≤ 1/2 β^c when f ≤ x. I must clarify the sign conditions: if f ≤ x, then |f - x| = x - f. If the reverse is true, |f - x| = f - x. This will help in my proof.
**Ensuring positivity in inequalities**

I need to confirm that β is positive to avoid introducing unnatural negativity. In this case, I'm only using β as a scaling constant to bound something positively. I'm not multiplying or dividing by β. The inequality I'm working with includes "1/2 * (beta : ℝ) ^ c," and I need to understand its sign to deduce expressions like "x - d ≤ 1/2 β^c." This clarity will help keep everything in the right direction.
**Examining β and inequalities**

If β^c is negative, then the inequality "x - d ≤ 1/2 β^c" would be false because the left-hand side is nonnegative. This comes from "abs (f - x) ≤ 1/2 β^c," which is also false if the right-hand side is negative. The lemma "exists_round_half_ulp" likely assumes that β is greater than 1 in its premises since that detail isn’t in the preconditions. While they noted "sorry" indicating it's not proven, I can still use it to deduce inequalities appropriately.
**Considering the lemma's applicability**

If the right-hand side (RHS) is negative, then the expression "abs ... ≤ negative" would be false. So, the lemma might not be particularly useful in that context. However, since they mentioned "sorry," indicating it’s not proven, it remains a theorem in the environment. I can still use it, even if I’m uncertain about its truth. It's a bit tricky, but I’ll have to keep that in mind moving forward!
**Structuring the proof**

I'm considering how to build my proof without creating contradictions or unsolved obligations. The key is using the statement from the inequality without needing positivity. For any f ≤ x, I have 0 ≤ x - f and several inequalities derived from "abs" properties. I can ensure "x - f ≤ abs(f - x)" always holds, allowing me to avoid needing positivity of β^c. Whether d equals u or d is less than u doesn't change the approach. In the end, I’ll also need to implement the proof with relevant structures and namespaces.
**Structuring the theorem's proof**

First, I need to show that xdn ≤ x and x ≤ xup from assumptions hdn and hup. This involves using definitions specific to my proof structure. For the case where xdn equals xup, I want to ensure that 0 ≤ β^c holds. Generally, we aim for 0 ≤ r, but proving this can be tricky, especially if r is negative. While I can avoid needing positivity of β^c, I realize I should assume 1 < β to satisfy the theorem for equal cases. This change ensures the expected semantics. Let's update the theorem accordingly!

**Analyzing inequalities**

I'm working with two inequalities: the first is x - xdn ≤ B when f ≤ xdn, and the second is xup - x ≤ B when xup ≤ f. Using disjunction, I can produce one of them, but to ensure the sum is ≤ 2B, I actually need both. However, c doesn’t guarantee both. In the case where xup is less than or equal to f, we can derive a relation for xup - x. Yet, I still need to address the first part separately!
**Evaluating bounds on claims**

I'm realizing it's not possible to have both claims hold true. The disjunction limits us in bounding (u - d) since we need to sum two halves. If only one side is bounded by B while the other remains unknown, demonstrating that the sum is ≤ 2B becomes impossible. We want to show that the sum is ≤ β^c = 2 * (1/2) β^c, requiring both halves to independently be ≤ B, but we can analyze each case separately. However, I can't bound u - x without making assumptions about the relationship with f and u.
**Exploring f-value existence**

I’m considering that we might choose two f values since exists_round_half_ulp could produce multiple f values. It states that there's at least one f, but it might exist on either side. We need two distinct representable values to bound both sides, but we don't have that guaranteed. Alternatively, if "exists_round_half_ulp" can be proven later to yield the half-ulp approximant we need, that could help. However, the requirement that x ≠ 0 doesn't really assist. I'll have to look closer at the custom property!
**Refining the approach**

I think I can circumvent the issue again. If f ≤ xdn, that gives us 'x - xdn ≤ x - f ≤ B.' I can also pick f from the same lemma and believe there exists some g close to x such that |g - x| ≤ B with a different f. However, the lemma only guarantees existence without specifying which side to choose. I need to refine my approach to show that the sum is ≤ β^c. It would help to show max(a, b) ≤ B, where a and b are defined as before, but the disjunction has limited implications.
**Exploring bounds with f values**

I'm reflecting on the implications of "f ∈ F" and how it relates to the conditions given. The existence of f doesn't guarantee uniqueness or a specific side, so I can't rely on that for bounding both sides. I need a stronger lemma like "Round_NE" but realize I need to bound both sides individually. The distances to x can help, but I must produce f on both sides simultaneously, which isn't guaranteed. 

I could use "round_DN_UP_lt" to deduce closeness, but ultimately, it seems challenging to establish bounds on both a and b. My earlier proofs seem insufficient, and since I can't access some necessary properties, I think I’ll have to work around these obstacles.
**Finding a solution with approximants**

I’m considering a solution that involves using two approximants. By applying the lemma to both x and -x, I can leverage the closure of the generic format under negation to get bounds on both sides.

First, I’ll apply exists_round_half_ulp at x to get f1 with a bound. Then, I’ll apply it at -x to obtain f2, which gives me g = -f2 that also belongs to F. I need to ensure that |g + x| ≤ B. There’s a similar bound for the cexp function since cexp(-x) equals cexp(x) due to the use of absolute values. I'll need to explore if there’s a lemma like "mag_opp" that confirms these properties!

**Evaluating approximants**

I'm considering two options regarding approximants: ideally, one should be on the left and the other on the right. However, there's no guarantee they won't both be on one side. Since f2 approximates -x, after negation, there's no coverage assurance. I wonder if some symmetrical property could guarantee one approximant on each side, but that's not rigorous. Ultimately, I need to ensure there are approximants on both sides; without that, I can't move forward. I'm feeling out of viable strategies.
**Analyzing bounds**

I'm exploring the idea of proving (u - d) ≤ 2B instead of just B. This would involve bounding the sum using two distances to the same f. I can derive that u - d ≤ |u - x| + |x - d|, which leads me to 2|f - x| ≤ 2B. While we aim for ≤ B, maybe we could achieve 1 * B with an added property that f equals either d or u, but that’s not guaranteed. I noticed the "round_DN_UP_lt" lemma might help establish bounds, yet things are still unclear.
**Determining the best approach**

I'm concluding that my best option is to rely on a stronger theorem from Ulp.lean called "round_UP_DN_ulp," which connects u - d = ulp x. Unfortunately, I can't import it directly. I could copy the minimal necessary lemma into the Round_generic file, possibly using "private" bridging theorems. However, this lemma relies on numerous definitions, making it quite large. I wonder if the Round_generic near the end has a "gap equals 'round_to_generic stepping'" lemma. Given my constraints, I still need to deliver a patch, though I can't add placeholders or optional "sorry" statements in the proof.
**Reassessing the situation**

I'm realizing this is a dead end. Given our inability to write a patch due to read-only status, I think I'll propose that the final answer includes suggested patch content for a proof using 'round_UP_DN_ulp' if we decide to import Ulp. But the orchestrator is advising against importing Ulp. Perhaps I could still import 'Ulp.lean' for 'ulp_prelim' or 'ulp_overshadow', but I need to avoid creating import cycles. Realistically, I might end up preparing a "No-action report" since proving the "Spacing bound" seems impossible with the current constraints and missing lemmas. The selection rule indicates this is the first "sorry" in Round_generic, so we need to fix one. If that’s not feasible, I should leave the helper lemmas and document everything, reminding myself to be persistent.
**Refining the spacing bound plan**

I've formulated a refined plan for implementing a robust version of spacing_bound. Under the condition 1 < beta, I'll utilize the half-ULP approximant lemma "exists_round_half_ulp" alongside "round_DN_UP_lt" for proof. However, I'm struggling with the necessity to touch on many definitions and needing to avoid import cycles.

While the "exists_round_half_ulp" lemma is currently incomplete, I think the final answer should still outline a suggested patch that encompasses a "No-action report." I'll ensure both approximants are covered to bound distances effectively, but the challenge remains in maintaining all bounds so that they comply with our constraints. Ultimately, my goal is to achieve correct bounding conditions, even as things feel a bit complicated!
**Reevaluating the bounding approach**

So, B is defined as 1/2 β^c, which means 2B is β^c. To have a sum less than or equal to 2B, we need to bound both a and b by B. The challenge is ensuring that both approximants provide independent bounds; if they yield the same side bound, we will still have a limitation. 

I’m pondering different methods, including the triangle inequality, but I'm realizing there are some complexities. To ensure good bounds, I’ll consider a simpler proof approach: if x is in F or if it’s equal to its upper or lower bounds, it's trivial. 

However, I might need to pivot toward modifying the theorem to propose a weaker but still meaningful bound. That's the best path forward given the constraints I’m facing!
**Finalizing the spacing_bound implementation**

At this stage, I'm planning to produce a final answer that patches 'spacing_bound' using the sum of two half-ULP approximants. I realize that I may be assuming the existence of 'exists_round_half_ulp' for both x and -x, which could cause inconsistencies.

I'll derive bounds for each approximant separately, but there is still uncertainty about guaranteeing both sides are covered. Since I can't verify the proofs fully due to constraints, I will ultimately produce a "No-action report" to document the challenges faced. 

Additionally, I’ll include patches with a skeleton proof for 'spacing_bound' to assist in future efforts. So, let’s summarize all this clearly!
**Producing a No-action report**

I need to produce a No-action report because there are unresolved items in the file along with prerequisites that aren't available. This means I cannot complete the task within the given constraints, so I’ll propose implementing it later. The instructions require fixing only one item, so I’ll explain the situation and then stop. I’ll make sure to include my analysis, overall plan, constraints, and the No-action report in my final answer.

I’m going to inspect Round_generic.lean and related lemmas, then attempt a minimal local proof for spacing_bound using existing structures.

Summary of findings and constraints:
- I examined FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_generic.lean and its dependencies. The target theorem spacing_bound is indeed at the top of the file with a sorry. It expects to bound the gap xup - xdn by (beta : ℝ)^(cexp beta fexp x).run.
- The natural route relies on the classic flocq “one ULP spacing” argument: if x ∈ F, then xdn = x = xup so the gap is 0. If x ∉ F, then the gap between the DN/UP neighbors is at most one ULP at x.
- This repository places the ULP machinery and the “gap equals one ULP” lemmas in FloatSpec/src/Core/Ulp.lean; however Round_generic.lean must not import Ulp.lean (Ulp imports Round_generic), so we cannot directly reuse those lemmas here.
- I tried to derive spacing without Ulp by using:
  - Round_pred definitions Rnd_DN_pt/Rnd_UP_pt,
  - scaled_mantissa and cexp properties in Generic_fmt,
  - Already-proved local tools like round_DN_UP_lt.
  A promising approach would be to bound the distances x - xdn and xup - x each by 1/2 · β^(cexp x) and add them. This requires a local “half-ULP approximant” lemma, which is present as exists_round_half_ulp in this file but currently marked sorry. Using it for one side only does not let us conclude on both sides, and we cannot show the existence of two approximants covering both sides without additional structure (e.g., the nearest rounding results from Round_NE or the ULP stepping lemmas from Ulp).
- Another approach is to show both xdn and xup share the same canonical exponent as x, express them as integers times β^(cexp x), and argue their mantissas differ by at most 1. That requires a tight cexp monotonicity/equality toolkit (e.g., lt_cexp_pos_ax, cexp_mono_pos_ax, cexp_ge_bpow_ax), which are also stubs marked sorry here.

Because of those dependencies, I cannot produce a solid proof for spacing_bound without either:
- importing Ulp.lean (prohibited: Ulp imports Round_generic), or
- completing several other sorry’d lemmas in this file (cexp monotonicity/equality and the half-ULP existence), which expands the scope beyond “exactly one item.”

No-action report (per the prompt’s fallback rule):
- Checked the target spacing_bound and nearby infrastructure. The minimal direct proof requires either ULP spacing lemmas from Ulp.lean (import cycle prevents use) or filling in multiple earlier sorry’d lemmas in Round_generic (cexp monotonicity and the half-ULP existence) to reconstruct a local proof. Both avenues exceed the allowed scope for repairing a single item.
- Verified there is no trivial in-file route leveraging only current non-sorry lemmas (e.g., round_DN_UP_lt is insufficient on its own without a way to bound both sides’ distances to x).
- There are no other “obvious” placeholder-like definitions we can port from Coq to substitute for the missing pieces without causing broader changes.

If you’d like, I can:
- Implement spacing_bound using the “two half‑ULP witnesses” strategy by first completing exists_round_half_ulp and the small battery of cexp/mag equalities, or
- Move spacing_bound into Ulp.lean as a corollary of the existing “gap equals one ULP” theorem and expose it via a small non-cyclic shim (requires a little refactor to avoid the import cycle).

Change Log & Reporting
- File: FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_generic.lean
- Target: spacing_bound at line 66
- Reason picked: sorry
- Approach: Analysis-only in this session (import-cycle blocks and multiple prerequisite sorries)
- Changes:
  - [ ] Definition modified? (no)
  - [ ] Spec modified? (no)
  - [ ] Reordering done? (no)
- Coq reference(s): /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core/Ulp.v, Round_NE.v (spacing and ulp lemmas underpin the bound)
- Build: not run due to read-only sandbox; proof not changed
- Notes: To unblock, either:
  - complete exists_round_half_ulp plus cexp monotone/pos lemmas locally, then prove spacing_bound by bounding both sides ≤ 1/2 ULP and summing; or
  - derive spacing_bound from Ulp’s “UP − DN = ulp x” identity by a small reorg to avoid cyclic imports.

Let me know which route you prefer, and I’ll proceed with a concrete patch accordingly.
