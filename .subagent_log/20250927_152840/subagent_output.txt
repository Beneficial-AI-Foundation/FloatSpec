[2025-09-27T07:28:54] User instructions:
System role: You are a Subagent Fixer for a Lean 4 proof repository. You must produce a minimal patch to fix exactly one target in the specified file, following strict policy. Do NOT apply or commit changes; only return the patch text and required notes.

Repo root: /home/hantao/code/FloatSpec
Target file: FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_generic.lean
Selection: { line_number: 66, reason: sorry }
Target item: theorem `spacing_bound`
Coq reference root: /home/hantao/code/flocq/src/Core (likely Generic_fmt.v for spacing lemmas)
Build command (for me to run): lake build
Policy summary:
- Scope: fix only the single selected item; allow minimal local helper lemmas (prefer `private`).
- Prohibited: introducing `axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`, or trivially-true variants; adding any new `sorry`; deleting or broadly editing unrelated code/specs.
- Definitions: no placeholder bodies; if you must alter a spec minimally to match Coq, justify and cite.
- Build must pass after patch; but YOU must not build or apply—only return patch and notes.
Required outputs:
1) A unified diff patch (or full new contents for the single file) touching only the target theorem and any tiny helper lemmas placed adjacent to it.
2) A short proof approach summary (direct / helper lemmas / Coq refs).
3) A compile note (what you expect to compile, local checks you conceptually did).
4) A Change Log entry block per the template below (I will append it).

Below is your task prompt body (adapted from scripts/subagent_prompt.md). Replace placeholders and follow strictly. Remember: return patch only, do NOT apply.

---
# Always Works™ Prompt

## Task

Fix proofs / theorems in `FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_generic.lean`.

## Goal

Repair exactly one item: `spacing_bound at line 66 (reason: sorry)`

---

## Prerequisites (read first)

* FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md (overall pipeline)
* ./CLAUDE.md (proof-writing conventions and mvcgen info)

---

## Process (ONE-BY-ONE; you return patch only)

1. Identify target using the Goal and record the exact line number and reason.
2. Understand spec & code (check Defs.lean for Rnd_DN_pt/Rnd_UP_pt and Generic_fmt.lean for generic_format; avoid changing specs unless necessary).
3. Plan: prove directly or via a small local helper.
4. Draft Implement:
   - Modify only the `spacing_bound` proof and, if necessary, introduce minimal `private` helper lemmas located immediately above `spacing_bound`.
   - Follow house style. Do not use any forbidden placeholders.
5. Check Implement: self-scan your diff for forbidden tokens (`axiom`, `admit`, `pure true`, `pure (decide True)`, `pure (decide ((0 : ℝ) ≤ 0))`). Ensure you are not introducing any new `sorry`.
6. Output patch (do NOT apply); I will compile it.
7. Polish: keep changes minimal and Coq-aligned.
8. Log: include the filled Change Log entry.

---

## Allowed vs. Prohibited Changes

Allowed (with restraint)
- Introduce small helper lemmas (`private`) close to the target.
- Reorder only if required to break a dependency cycle; document it.

Prohibited
- Deleting existing theorems/defs.
- Using `axiom`, `admit`, or any non-`sorry` placeholder.
- Expanding scope beyond the single selected target.
- Broad spec rewrites or syntax changes to Hoare triples.

---

## Proof Strategy Guidelines

- Prefer using the existing definitions:
  * F := fun y => (generic_format beta fexp y).run
  * Rnd_DN_pt F x xdn and Rnd_UP_pt F x xup as in FloatSpec/src/Core/Defs.lean
- Aim to derive `xup - xdn ≤ (beta : ℝ) ^ (cexp beta fexp x).run` using spacing properties typical in Flocq’s Generic_fmt.v. It is acceptable to prove a slightly simpler bound that is valid under the imported abstractions.
- Avoid depending on later theorems that are `sorry` in this file; rely on Defs/Generic_fmt and Mathlib basics.
- Keep the final statement identical unless a minimal, Coq-justified tweak is essential (document if so).

---

**Exploring spacing lemmas**

I think the spacing lemma probably uses the bpow spacing property. I should open Raux to check the definitions for mag and cexp, but I noticed that cexp isn't defined in Generic_fmt. Also, Round_generic imports Generic_fmt, which is important to note. So, I need to look for any existing spacing lemmas in Generic_fmt or other places, particularly for terms like "spacing" or "ulp." I guess a search is the next step!

**Investigating proof properties**

I'm looking at the definitions of Ulp and their use of spacing, but it seems I only need to focus on fixing the spacing_bound proof. It might be best to avoid relying on Ulp if I can help it. So, let's check Raux and see the properties of bpow that are being used. That could give me the clarity I need to tackle my proof effectively. This process feels a bit tangled, but I’m getting there!

**Analyzing mathematical terms**

I’m checking Ulp.lean for connections between gap and ulp. There’s this "local bridge lemma" mentioning how the gap between UP and DN equals one ULP at a specific point. Lines 5365-5373 discuss pending spacing lemmas that depend on what we provide. Given the limitations, focusing on proving spacing_bound in Round_generic seems essential. I also want to look at the lines before spacing_bound in Round_generic to see what resources are available.

**Considering mathematical definitions**

I’m thinking about the exponent inequality and whether we really need to enforce positivity. It seems that the right-hand side can be large if we use the Real powers with integer exponents, even for any integer base. I wonder about the implications if β is less than or equal to one. Real zpow with integer exponents uses that definition, but I’m not sure if it applies to negative bases. In mathlib, the concept of zpow is extended to negative exponents, but that raises questions about its definition with negative bases.
**Exploring exponent properties**

I’m examining the function Real.rpow and how it differs from traditional exponent definitions. For integer exponents, they work in a monoid with zero, while negative exponents require a group. In the context of ℝ under multiplication, it acts as a group. This raises questions about the bound xup - xdn ≤ β^e for negative bases, especially when β is negative and the exponent is odd. Usually, β is greater than 1, and I’m realizing that many theorems typically include this precondition. The file I’m reviewing seems to have omitted it, which might lead to misunderstandings.
**Proving an inequality**

I’m considering providing a proof for the inequality "xup - xdn ≤ (beta : ℝ) ^ (cexp beta fexp x).run." To start, I can say that xup - xdn is less than or equal to its absolute value, which I can bound to a positive quantity. However, if the right-hand side is negative and the left side is nonnegative, it seems the inequality will always hold. Since rounding dictates that xdn is less than or equal to xup, the left side is nonnegative. Yet, if the base is negative or between 0 and 1, that may lead to unusual outcomes.
**Analyzing float conditions**

I’m reflecting on the typical conditions for Floats, where the base is usually positive. The Valid_exp class might imply a requirement of base > 1, but that's not explicitly defined in the class. However, many theorems in this repository specify "beta > 1" as a precondition. To be on the safe side, I think we should aim to produce a proof that applies to any integer base. Although the spacing_bound isn't actively utilized, we need to ensure our proof type-checks properly. I'll consider proving "xup - xdn ≤ max of something" by bounding it to Real.
**Clarifying inequality proof**

I’m realizing I need to show an inequality where the right-hand side matches exactly with (beta : ℝ) ^ (cexp x).run. I can prove that both xup and xdn equal x due to rounding in the same set, but I can’t assume x is in F. Perhaps I can demonstrate there exist xdn and xup where xdn = xup. I believe the theorem accepts inputs like "Rnd_DN_pt F x xdn → Rnd_UP_pt F x xup." 

If both conditions are true, I can then show the bound. I'll aim to deduce that xdn ≤ xup, indicating a nonnegative difference. However, without additional structure, bounding using power isn't straightforward. I may utilize generic_format_bpow for some rational representation of β power. In choosing the exponent wisely, I’ll consider if any attempts can simplify the proof. Also, I should investigate similar proofs in other modules to inform my approach, particularly searching for "spacing_bound" in the repository.

**Exploring mathematical inequalities**

I’m looking into how "cexp" is defined in Generic_fmt and how it operates without requiring positivity. It seems to return some Int without preconditions, which is good. I'm considering proving an inequality involving "xup - xdn" and "β^e". However, I'm not quite reaching a solid conclusion on the bounds. I should be mindful of the restrictions and take a step back. Maybe proving a slightly simpler bound, as suggested, is the way to go!
