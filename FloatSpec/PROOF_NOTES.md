FloatSpec Core Raux: Proof Note (2025-09-20)

Context
- File: FloatSpec/src/Core/Raux.lean
- Task: Fix the first incomplete proof in the file.

Change Summary
- Corrected the boolean helper `Rle_bool` to return a proper boolean via `decide`:
  - Before: `noncomputable def Rle_bool (x y : ℝ) : Id Bool := pure (x ≤ y)`
  - After:  `noncomputable def Rle_bool (x y : ℝ) : Id Bool := pure (decide (x ≤ y))`

Rationale
- The project’s pipeline and prior proofs require `Bool`/`Prop` conversion using `decide`.
- Returning `pure (x ≤ y)` has the wrong type (`Prop`), causing mismatch with Hoare triples that expect `Bool` results.

Fixed Proof
- The very first theorem with an incomplete proof was `Rle_bool_false`:
  - The proof now unfolds `Rle_bool`, reduces the Hoare triple with `simp [wp, PostCond.noThrow, Id.run, pure]`, and uses the precondition to close the goal directly.

Notes
- Adjusted nearby proofs (`Rle_bool_spec`, `Rle_bool_true`) to match the updated `Rle_bool` using the standard `wp` simplification pattern.
- No other theorems were modified.
