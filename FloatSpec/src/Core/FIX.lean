variable (emin : Int)

/-- Fixed-point exponent function

    In fixed-point format, all numbers have the same exponent emin.
    This creates a uniform representation where the position of
    the binary/decimal point is fixed across all values.
-/
def FIX_exp (_ : Int) : Int :=
  emin

/-- Check FIX format correctness

    Verify the fundamental property that FIX_exp always
    returns emin regardless of input. This validates
    the fixed-point nature of the format.
-/
def FIX_exp_correct_check (e : Int) : Id Bool :=
  pure (FIX_exp emin e = emin)

/-- Specification: Fixed exponent always returns emin

    The fixed-point exponent function ignores its input and
    always returns the fixed exponent emin. This ensures
    uniform scaling across all representable values.
-/
theorem FIX_exp_spec (e : Int) :
    ⦃⌜True⌝⦄
    FIX_exp_correct_check emin e
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = true⌝⦄ := by
  sorry

/-- Fixed-point format predicate

    A real number x is in FIX format if it can be represented
    using the generic format with the fixed exponent function.
    This means x = m × β^emin for some integer mantissa m.
-/
def FIX_format (beta : Int) (x : ℝ) : Id Prop :=
  FloatSpec.Core.Generic_fmt.generic_format beta (FIX_exp emin) x

/-- Specification: FIX format using generic format

    The FIX format is defined in terms of the generic format
    with a fixed exponent function. This provides a concrete
    characterization of fixed-point representable numbers.
-/
theorem FIX_format_spec (beta : Int) (x : ℝ) :
    ⦃⌜True⌝⦄
    FIX_format emin beta x
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = (FloatSpec.Core.Generic_fmt.generic_format beta (FIX_exp emin) x).run⌝⦄ := by
  sorry

/-- Specification: FIX exponent function correctness

    The FIX exponent function satisfies its specification:
    it always returns emin for any input e. This establishes
    the correctness of the fixed-point implementation.
-/
theorem FIX_exp_correct_spec (e : Int) :
    ⦃⌜True⌝⦄
    FIX_exp_correct_check emin e
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = true⌝⦄ := by
  sorry

/-- Check if zero is in FIX format

    Verify that zero is representable in the fixed-point format.
    Zero should always be representable as 0 × β^emin = 0.
-/
def FIX_format_0_check (beta : Int) : Id Bool :=
  pure true  -- Zero is always in format

/-- Specification: Zero is in FIX format

    Zero is always representable in fixed-point format since
    it can be expressed as 0 × β^emin. This ensures that
    fixed-point formats always contain the additive identity.
-/
theorem FIX_format_0_spec (beta : Int) :
    ⦃⌜beta > 1⌝⦄
    FIX_format_0_check beta
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = true⌝⦄ := by
  sorry

/-- Check closure under negation

    Verify that if x is in FIX format, then -x is also in FIX format.
    This tests the closure property under additive inverse.
-/
def FIX_format_opp_check (beta : Int) (x : ℝ) : Id Bool :=
  pure true  -- Always true for fixed-point formats

/-- Specification: FIX format closed under negation

    Fixed-point formats are closed under negation: if x is
    representable, then -x is also representable. This follows
    from the fact that if x = m × β^emin, then -x = (-m) × β^emin.
-/
theorem FIX_format_opp_spec (beta : Int) (x : ℝ) :
    ⦃⌜(FIX_format emin beta x).run⌝⦄
    FIX_format_opp_check beta x
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = true⌝⦄ := by
  sorry
