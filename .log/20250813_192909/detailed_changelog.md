# Detailed Changelog - Refactor Generic_fmt Module

## Date: 2025-08-13 19:29:09

## Summary
Refactored the Generic_fmt module to separate verified and unverified theorems, improving code organization and maintainability in the FloatSpec project.

## Motivation
The Generic_fmt.lean file contained a mix of fully verified theorems and work-in-progress theorems marked with `sorry`. This made it difficult to:
- Track progress on proof completion
- Understand which components were production-ready
- Maintain and review the codebase

## Changes Made

### 1. New File Creation
- **FloatSpec/src/Core/Round_generic.lean** (318 lines)
  - Contains all 22 unverified theorems previously in Generic_fmt
  - Includes 3 noncomputable definitions with `sorry` implementations
  - Maintains the same API and functionality

### 2. File Modifications

#### Core Module Updates
- **Generic_fmt.lean**: Reduced from ~900 to ~560 lines
  - Removed all functions with `sorry` proofs
  - Kept only verified theorems and core definitions
  - Maintained essential types and verified helper functions

#### Namespace Corrections
Fixed incorrect namespace references in 12 files:
- Changed `GenericFmt` to `Generic_fmt` throughout
- Updated imports to include Round_generic where needed
- Files affected:
  - Core: FIX, FLT, FLX, FTZ, Round_NE, Ulp
  - Calc: Div, Plus, Sqrt
  - IEEE754: Binary

### 3. Moved Functions
Key unverified theorems moved to Round_generic:
- `generic_format_bpow` and `generic_format_bpow'`
- `scaled_mantissa_generic`
- `cexp_fexp` and `cexp_fexp_pos`
- `mantissa_small_pos` and related bounds
- Rounding functions (`round_DN_to_format`, `round_UP_to_format`, etc.)
- Error bound theorems
- Format intersection and precision characterization

### 4. Import Structure
New dependency graph:
```
Generic_fmt (verified core)
    ↓
Round_generic (unverified extensions)
    ↓
[FIX, FLT, FLX, FTZ, Round_NE, Ulp, Calc modules]
```

## Impact
- **No breaking changes**: All existing code continues to work
- **Improved clarity**: Clear separation between proven and unproven components
- **Better maintainability**: Easier to track proof progress
- **Cleaner imports**: Modules can choose to import only verified components

## Build Status
✅ Project builds successfully with all tests passing
✅ No functionality changes, only organizational improvements

## Next Steps
- Continue proving theorems in Round_generic.lean
- Eventually merge proven theorems back into Generic_fmt.lean
- Consider similar refactoring for other modules with mixed verification status
