    Refactor Float_prop.lean to remove Hoare triple specifications
    
    This commit removes the experimental Hoare triple specification approach
    from Float_prop.lean and returns to direct Lean theorem formulations.
    The change simplifies the codebase and aligns better with standard
    Lean mathematical proof practices.
    
    Key changes:
    - Removed Std.Do.Triple and mvcgen dependencies
    - Converted Hoare triple specifications back to standard theorems
    - Began implementation of core float properties including mag function
    - Started proper Rcompare_F2R theorem implementation
    - Updated CLAUDE.md with completed module status
    
    This refactoring makes the code more maintainable and closer to the
    original Coq Flocq library structure while leveraging Lean's native
    proof capabilities.
