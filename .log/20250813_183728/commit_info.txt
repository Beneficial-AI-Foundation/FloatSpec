    Add Coq proof documentation and fix namespace in Core modules
    
    This commit adds comprehensive Coq theorem documentation to Digits.lean
    and fixes the namespace in Generic_fmt.lean. The documentation provides
    valuable context from the original Coq Flocq library, helping future
    implementers understand the proof structures and requirements.
    
    Key changes:
    - Added detailed Coq theorem statements and proofs as documentation comments
    - Fixed namespace from GenericFmt to Generic_fmt for consistency
    - Removed unnecessary import of Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Pow.Real
    - Moved helper lemmas (mag_neg, mag_abs) into the main implementation
    - Enhanced theorem specifications with original Coq proof context
    
    This documentation-focused update helps bridge the gap between the Coq
    Flocq library and our Lean 4 implementation, making it easier to complete
    the proof obligations in future work.
