# Commit Summary: Refactor Calc Module with Hoare Triple Specifications

## Date: 2025-08-11 18:39:55

## Overview
Major refactoring of the entire Calc module to adopt formal specification patterns using Hoare triple syntax. This change brings the Calc module in line with the formal verification approach established in Zaux.lean, ensuring consistent specification style across the FloatSpec project.

## Key Changes

### 1. Hoare Triple Specification Adoption
- Converted all 6 Calc module files to use the Hoare triple syntax: `⦃⌜precondition⌝⦄ function ⦃⇓result => postcondition⦄`
- Separated function definitions (`def`) from theorem specifications (`theorem`)
- Made function bodies clean and minimal, moving complexity to specifications

### 2. Files Modified in Calc Module
- **Bracket.lean**: Location and interval bracketing operations with inbetween predicates
- **Operations.lean**: Basic float arithmetic (alignment, addition, multiplication)
- **Div.lean**: Float division with precision control
- **Sqrt.lean**: Square root computation with magnitude bounds
- **Round.lean**: Rounding operations with different modes
- **Plus.lean**: Optimized addition with format awareness

### 3. Documentation Improvements
- Added comprehensive documentation comments for each function
- Included detailed explanations of mathematical properties
- Documented preconditions and postconditions clearly

### 4. PIPELINE.md Enhancement
Added new section "Writing Formal Proofs" with:
- Pre-proof verification guidelines
- MCP tool usage instructions for Lean development
- Incremental proof development strategies
- Common proof patterns specific to FloatSpec
- Debugging tips and best practices
- Example workflow for proof development

### 5. Technical Fixes
- Fixed type references (FlocqFloat, F2R, Location)
- Added missing `noncomputable` declarations for Real-valued functions
- Corrected namespace issues (Generic_fmt → GenericFmt)
- Fixed F2R usage with `.run` to extract values from Id monad
- Resolved parameter passing issues in Hoare triple specifications

## Impact
This refactoring establishes a consistent formal specification pattern across the FloatSpec project, making it easier to:
1. Write and verify formal proofs
2. Maintain consistent documentation standards
3. Use MCP tools effectively for Lean development
4. Onboard new contributors with clear patterns

## Next Steps
With the Calc module now properly specified, the next priorities are:
1. Begin writing actual proofs for the specified theorems
2. Apply similar refactoring to other modules as needed
3. Continue developing the Core functionality following the dependency graph
