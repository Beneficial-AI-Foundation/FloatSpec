## Commit: Add pow_strict_mono_int lemma and clean up temporary files

### Summary
This commit introduces a new helper lemma for proving strict monotonicity of power functions with integer bases and removes temporary test files that were no longer needed.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **FloatSpec/src/Core/Digits.lean**
- **Added**: `pow_strict_mono_int` private lemma (lines 1088-1119)
  - Proves strict monotonicity: if `m < n` then `beta^m < beta^n` for `beta > 1`
  - Uses induction on `n` with case analysis
  - Handles two cases: when `m+1 = n` and when `m+1 < n`
  - Essential for proving properties about digit manipulation with power functions
  
- **Fixed**: `Zdigit_ext_nonneg` theorem (line 1649)
  - Changed from `Int.ofNat_natAbs` to `Int.natAbs_of_nonneg`
  - Corrects the function call to match the actual Lean 4 API
  - Ensures proper type conversion for non-negative integers

#### 2. **iterate.sh**
- **Updated**: Script instructions for theorem fixing workflow
  - Clarified to focus on "only the very first" incomplete proof
  - Added explicit instruction to use MCP tools or `lake build` for error location
  - Emphasized working hard on single theorem rather than attempting multiple
  - Removed verbose debugging philosophy section to streamline instructions
  - Changed timeout from 2 hours to 3 hours for longer proof attempts
  - Removed `-c` flag from claude command for cleaner execution

#### 3. **Removed Files**
- Deleted 5 temporary test files that were no longer needed:
  - `fwIn.txt` - Forward input test file
  - `fwOut.txt` - Forward output test file  
  - `wdErr.txt` - Working directory error test file
  - `wdIn.txt` - Working directory input test file
  - `wdOut.txt` - Working directory output test file

### Impact
- **Proof Infrastructure**: The new `pow_strict_mono_int` lemma strengthens the available tools for proving properties about power functions, particularly useful for digit manipulation proofs
- **Code Quality**: Fixed API usage in `Zdigit_ext_nonneg` ensures compatibility with current Lean 4 standard library
- **Repository Cleanliness**: Removal of test files reduces clutter and improves repository organization
- **Developer Experience**: Streamlined iterate.sh script provides clearer instructions for systematic proof completion

### File Statistics
- 2 files modified (FloatSpec/src/Core/Digits.lean, iterate.sh)
- 5 files deleted (test files)
- 1,250 insertions, 7,722 deletions (net reduction due to test file removal)
- Primary changes focused on mathematical proof infrastructure

### Related Work
This continues the ongoing effort to complete proofs in the Digits module, building on previous commits that addressed theorems like `Zslice_slice` and `tdiv_pow_succ_assoc`.
