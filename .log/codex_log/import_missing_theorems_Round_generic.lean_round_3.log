## Task: Introduce Missing Theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}

## Scope

Introduce missing theorems in the file. You can find the record of missing theorems in file /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/FloatSpec/FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, which is generated by comparing the Coq and Lean versions of the file. For all the missing theorems in the file, find their corresponding Coq implementation in /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/flocq/src/Core and implement them in Lean, using the same name and similar syntax with existing theorems. Leave the proofs empty for now.

### Prerequisites

1. **Read documentation first:**
    - FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md - understand the overall pipeline
    - ./CLAUDE.md - focus on proof writing instructions and mvcgen info

### Core Requirements

### Theorem Importing Process

1. **Follow the Zfast_div_eucl_spec example** in Zaux.lean and other theorems in current file as your template
2. **ONE-BY-ONE approach is mandatory:**
    - Write ONE theorem
    - Use the hoare triple syntax (introduced in FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md and CLAUDE.md) to write the theorem
    - Check immediately with mcp tool or `lake build`
    - Fix any errors before proceeding to next theorem
    - Never batch multiple theorems without checking
3. After writing each theorem, check whether they are aligned with the Coq implementation. If so, mark them as complete in the record file.

### Before Writing Each Theorem

1. **Verify function implementation** - ensure the function body is correct
2. **Preserve syntax** - do NOT change hoare triple syntax unless absolutely necessary
    - Think multiple times before modifying specs or code body
    - If changes are needed, decompose complex specs rather than rewriting

### Compilation Verification

- **After EVERY theorem:** Run `mcp` (preferred) or `lake build xxx`
- **Definition of complete:** NO errors or 'pure true' statements
- **Never mark as complete if:**
    - Any errors or 'pure true' statements remain
    - Compilation returns errors
    - Sorry is allowed, but only as a placeholder for the proof


### Important Notes

- Use MCP tool instead of bash command to get diagnostic messages!
- Skip already-imported theorems!! There might be warnings be just leave them there!
- You can use exisiting (and proved) theorem to assist your spec writing. If a theorem is necessary but not introduced, you can turn to work on that first. The useful theorems might not be in the same file, but in the import list
- When you are trying to use a certain lemma, check through mcp tools (or https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) to make sure the lemma exists. Else, write your own implementation of the lemma.

### Success Criteria

✅ All error and 'pure true' statements eliminated
✅ Clean compilation for entire file
✅ Each theorem verified individually before moving on

**Implementing missing theorems**

I think I’ll start by picking the first file that’s missing theorems. My plan is to implement them one by one, building on each theorem after I complete it. I wonder how the repository is structured, and I’ll take a closer look at that. Exploring the structure will help me understand where to go next, and I'll be able to tackle each theorem more effectively. This could be an interesting process!

I’m going to open the docs and the comparison report, then scan the target Core files to identify the first missing theorem to implement.

# FloatSpec Proof Writing Pipeline

## Key Insights from BooleanComparisons Proof Writing Experience

### 1. The `decide` Pattern for Bool/Prop Compatibility
**Critical Discovery**: When writing Hoare triple specifications that return `Bool`, the postcondition must use `decide` to convert from `Prop` to `Bool`.

```lean
-- WRONG: Type mismatch between Bool and Prop
theorem Zeq_bool_spec (x y : Int) :
    ⦃⌜True⌝⦄
    Zeq_bool x y
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = (x = y)⌝⦄  -- Error: (x = y) is Prop, not Bool

-- CORRECT: Using decide for proper type conversion
theorem Zeq_bool_spec (x y : Int) :
    ⦃⌜True⌝⦄
    Zeq_bool x y
    ⦃⇓result => ⌜result = decide (x = y)⌝⦄  -- decide converts Prop to Bool

# FloatSpec Project Overview

You are a functional programmer working in Lean 4.

**Main Goal**: Create a provable Lean float implementation with formal verification. Use bootstrapping from feedback like compiler error messages to guide development.

## IMPORTANT: "Keep Going" Context

If you're told to "keep going" without context, you're likely working on:
1. **Float Implementation** - Developing provable floating-point arithmetic
2. **Specification Writing** - Creating formal specifications for float operations
3. **Test Writing** - Add more property-based tests using Plausible

## General Programming Philosophy

Programming is about onomastics (naming), composition (functoriality), and caching. Think conformally at every scale and across scales.

Build a pit of success: internal systems that grow as a whole outwards, never allowing the fallible external world to leak in except at boundaries. Meet the external world at well-defined interfaces.

When solving problems, write tooling/linters/auto-fixers to widen the pit of success. Use rigid compiler error messages and linter warnings to guide future users (**including** AI) toward correct solutions.

# Core Theorems Comparison: Coq vs Lean (FloatSpec)

This document lists all theorem-like declarations in flocq/src/Core (*.v) and FloatSpec/src/Core (*.lean), grouped by file, and indicates for each Coq declaration whether a corresponding Lean theorem/lemma exists. Matching is based on exact/normalized/substr name matches and, when available, explicit Coq references in Lean comments.

**Selecting a file for theorems**

I need to select a file as the instructions mention introducing missing theorems, which are listed per file. It looks like the user expects me to tackle one file at a time. Since they haven’t specified, I want to pick a file with fewer missing theorems to get done quickly. FTZ and Digits seem fully matched, while FIX has several missing. Let’s open FIX.lean and check its style and existing theorems.

**Searching for lemmas**

I’m realizing that Round_generic has a lot of useful helpers and format proofs. It sounds like the succ and pred lemmas likely show up in either Round_pred or Round_generic. I should search for "succ" or "pred" in Core to find more information about that. It’s definitely a step worth taking to see how these concepts are connected in the broader context!

**Evaluating the theorem structure**

I realized that the file already includes a round_FLT_FLX theorem with a pair-of-values structure, making our attempt redundant. I’m glad we didn’t patch it. Many skeletons already exist in FLT, so I’m considering that the first missing theorem might go in FIX.lean? Though FIX seems complete, there are many missing in Generic_fmt. Looking at the comparison, it suggests that Generic_fmt.lean likely has several skeletons, so I’ll explore to see if `valid_exp_large` is present, for example.

**Exploring negligible_exp_FLT**

I'm trying to figure out what "negligible_exp_FLT" means. It seems related to the Generic_fmt's negligible exponent property, which might be complicated. A better start might be looking into "Zaux.v" for missing theorems like "Zpower_pos_gt_0," "Zeven_Zpower_odd," and "radix_gt_0." Maybe there's a Zaux.lean file that has a lot of this implemented. It could be worth opening it to check!

**Clarifying theorem implementation**

I'm considering implementing the Rabs_le_inv_spec, which states that |x| ≤ y ↔ -y ≤ x ≤ y for y ≥ 0, but I'm not entirely sure. Without clear specifications, I might risk using the wrong syntax. It seems that Rabs_le_inv is likely the inverse of Rabs_ge, but it's a bit ambiguous. Instead, I think it’s better to ask the user to specify which file to target. I'll propose FLT as a good candidate since it has many missing theorems.

Quick alignment check: the comparison report shows many Coq→Lean gaps across Core. Several files (FLT, FLX, FIX, Raux) already contain many skeletons with sorry placeholders, and they compile with only warnings per diagnostics.

To proceed precisely with your “Introduce Missing Theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}” task, I need the specific target file for ${file}. Options with clear gaps:

- FLT.lean: Many Coq theorems exist; most core ones already have skeletons here (e.g., generic_format_FLT_bpow, FLT_format_bpow, generic_format_FLT_FLX, cexp_FLT_FLX, cexp_FLT_FIX, generic_format_FIX_FLT, generic_format_FLT_FIX, ulp_FLT_0/small/le/gt/exact_shift, generic_format_FLT_1, generic_format_FLX_FLT). Remaining FLT items like succ/pred shift lemmas depend on functions (succ, pred) not defined in this Lean port, so those are not good first targets.

- FLX.lean: Several items are missing in our Lean file: succ_FLX_1, succ_FLX_exact_shift, pred_FLX_exact_shift, eq_0_round_0_FLX, gt_0_round_gt_0_FLX. Of these, eq_0_round_0_FLX and gt_0_round_gt_0_FLX would require the rounding framework (Valid_rnd, round) beyond our current simple round_to_generic; the succ/pred lemmas require succ/pred definitions. These are therefore not ideal as first simple skeletons.

- FIX.lean: The core missing Coq items (generic_format_FIX, FIX_format_generic, FIX_format_satisfies_any, ulp_FIX, round_FIX_IZR) are already present as skeletons with sorry here.

- Raux.lean: Many real-analysis lemmas are missing; we can safely add simple spec-style skeletons here without introducing new infra, but we need to match the Coq statements.

What I can do next
- If you confirm a specific file (e.g., FLT.lean), I’ll add exactly one missing theorem skeleton at a time, following your one-by-one workflow (Zfast_div_eucl_spec style), run Lean diagnostics after each, and continue until that file matches the Coq list.
- If you prefer Raux.lean, I can start with concrete, low-dependency lemmas from the Coq list (e.g., Zfloor/Zceil/Ztrunc characterizations, Rcompare variants) and stub them one at a time.
- If you want me to pick, I recommend FLT.lean because we already verified it compiles cleanly with sorry placeholders, and the remaining skeletons I can add next that don’t require new primitives are:
  - negligible_exp_FLT (may require negligible_exp infra—if absent, I’ll skip)
  - round_FLT_FLX is already skeletonized at the bottom; next I can add generic round wrappers that simply defer to Round_generic when possible.

Please tell me which Core file to target for ${file}. Once chosen, I’ll:
- Add one missing theorem (skeleton, no proof), mirroring Coq’s name and structure.
- Run diagnostics for that file and fix any signature or import issues.
- Repeat per your one-by-one rule until the file’s missing list is covered.
