## Task: Introduce Missing Theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}

## Scope

Introduce missing theorems in the file. You can find the record of missing theorems in file /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/FloatSpec/FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, which is generated by comparing the Coq and Lean versions of the file. For all the missing theorems in the file, find their corresponding Coq implementation in /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/flocq/src/Core and implement them in Lean, using the same name and similar syntax with existing theorems. Leave the proofs empty for now.

### Prerequisites

1. **Read documentation first:**
    - FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md - understand the overall pipeline
    - ./CLAUDE.md - focus on proof writing instructions and mvcgen info

### Core Requirements

### Theorem Importing Process

1. **Follow the Zfast_div_eucl_spec example** in Zaux.lean and other theorems in current file as your template
2. **ONE-BY-ONE approach is mandatory:**
    - Write ONE theorem
    - Use the hoare triple syntax (introduced in FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md and CLAUDE.md) to write the theorem
    - Check immediately with mcp tool or `lake build`
    - Fix any errors before proceeding to next theorem
    - Never batch multiple theorems without checking
3. After writing each theorem, check whether they are aligned with the Coq implementation. If so, mark them as complete in the record file.

### Before Writing Each Theorem

1. **Verify function implementation** - ensure the function body is correct
2. **Preserve syntax** - do NOT change hoare triple syntax unless absolutely necessary
    - Think multiple times before modifying specs or code body
    - If changes are needed, decompose complex specs rather than rewriting

### Compilation Verification

- **After EVERY theorem:** Run `mcp` (preferred) or `lake build xxx`
- **Definition of complete:** NO errors or 'pure true' statements
- **Never mark as complete if:**
    - Any errors or 'pure true' statements remain
    - Compilation returns errors
    - Sorry is allowed, but only as a placeholder for the proof


### Important Notes

- Use MCP tool instead of bash command to get diagnostic messages!
- Skip already-imported theorems!! There might be warnings be just leave them there!
- You can use exisiting (and proved) theorem to assist your spec writing. If a theorem is necessary but not introduced, you can turn to work on that first. The useful theorems might not be in the same file, but in the import list
- When you are trying to use a certain lemma, check through mcp tools (or https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) to make sure the lemma exists. Else, write your own implementation of the lemma.

### Success Criteria

✅ All error and 'pure true' statements eliminated
✅ Clean compilation for entire file
✅ Each theorem verified individually before moving on

**Implementing missing theorems**

I need to implement missing theorems in the Core subdirectory. First, I’ll consult the record file, Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, to find out what's missing. Then, I'll edit the corresponding Lean file in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}. But which file am I supposed to use? The user mentioned a placeholder, ${file}. I might need to check all files since the task mentions introducing missing theorems generally. I’ll open the repository to see what's noted in the comparison file.
[2025-09-16T02:50:24] codex

I’m going to inspect the comparison record and the Core source files to identify which theorems are missing and where to add them.

**Identifying the target file**

I need to determine which file in Core is the target since the user hasn't specified one. There might be multiple files we can choose from based on the comparison file. The instructions mention introducing missing theorems in a specific file, likely expecting a specific environment variable related to it. I should consider files like FIX.lean, FLT.lean, and others, and choose one. It might be best to implement one theorem at a time, starting with the Lean files to see what’s present and what's missing.**Exploring Hoare Triple Syntax**

I'm seeing mentions of Hoare triple syntax in CLAUDE and the pipeline. In previous tasks, there were references to "spec" theorems wrapped in Hoare triple syntax, so it’s likely I need to follow a similar style here. To get a clearer understanding, I should open one of the files. I think starting with FloatSpec/src/Core/FIX.lean would be a good idea to see how they structured it and what details I need to include.

**Clarifying missing theorems**

This is quite a long task. I need to introduce missing theorems into the specified file, which is indicated by ${file}. I see that there are many missing theorems compared to another file, Generic_fmt.lean. However, I should clarify which file I'm supposed to work on, as that isn't clear from the prompt. It seems a good idea to ask the user to specify the Core file to avoid confusion moving forward.**Identifying missing theorems**

I notice that the mapping for FIX has some missing items, while others are present. For FLT, theorems seem complete. The user might be looking for missing theorems in "Generic_fmt.lean." It seems best to ask which file they want to focus on, as that isn't clear yet. Meanwhile, I can start by implementing a missing theorem stub from Generic_fmt.lean based on an existing Coq file in my directory. I'll check the current content and style there.

I’ll open Generic_fmt.lean to see current theorems and identify a missing one to add as a stub.

**Clarifying file specifications**

It seems like "pure true" statements are being eliminated, but there are still many true returns in check functions. However, they're part of spec theorems that expect results to be true. This raises some uncertainty about whether any leftovers should exist. To clarify, I should ask the user which file I should work on. I can provide options like FIX, FLT, FLX, FTZ, and Generic_fmt, and proceed one step at a time from there.
[2025-09-16T02:52:03] codex

Which Core file should I target? Options from the comparison record include:
- `FIX.lean`
- `FLT.lean`
- `FLX.lean`
- `FTZ.lean`
- `Generic_fmt.lean`
- `Float_prop.lean`

Tell me the `${file}` and I’ll add the missing theorems one-by-one (Coq-aligned names, Lean stubs with hoare triple syntax), checking after each with diagnostics.
