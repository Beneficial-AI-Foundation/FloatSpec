## Task: Introduce Missing Theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}

## Scope

Introduce missing theorems in the file. You can find the record of missing theorems in file /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/FloatSpec/FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, which is generated by comparing the Coq and Lean versions of the file. For all the missing theorems in the file, find their corresponding Coq implementation in /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/flocq/src/Core and implement them in Lean, using the same name and similar syntax with existing theorems. Leave the proofs empty for now.

### Prerequisites

1. **Read documentation first:**
    - FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md - understand the overall pipeline
    - ./CLAUDE.md - focus on proof writing instructions and mvcgen info

### Core Requirements

### Theorem Importing Process

1. **Follow the Zfast_div_eucl_spec example** in Zaux.lean and other theorems in current file as your template
2. **ONE-BY-ONE approach is mandatory:**
    - Write ONE theorem
    - Use the hoare triple syntax (introduced in FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md and CLAUDE.md) to write the theorem
    - Check immediately with mcp tool or `lake build`
    - Fix any errors before proceeding to next theorem
    - Never batch multiple theorems without checking
3. After writing each theorem, check whether they are aligned with the Coq implementation. If so, mark them as complete in the record file.

### Before Writing Each Theorem

1. **Verify function implementation** - ensure the function body is correct
2. **Preserve syntax** - do NOT change hoare triple syntax unless absolutely necessary
    - Think multiple times before modifying specs or code body
    - If changes are needed, decompose complex specs rather than rewriting

### Compilation Verification

- **After EVERY theorem:** Run `mcp` (preferred) or `lake build xxx`
- **Definition of complete:** NO errors or 'pure true' statements
- **Never mark as complete if:**
    - Any errors or 'pure true' statements remain
    - Compilation returns errors
    - Sorry is allowed, but only as a placeholder for the proof


### Important Notes

- Use MCP tool instead of bash command to get diagnostic messages!
- Skip already-imported theorems!! There might be warnings be just leave them there!
- You can use exisiting (and proved) theorem to assist your spec writing. If a theorem is necessary but not introduced, you can turn to work on that first. The useful theorems might not be in the same file, but in the import list
- When you are trying to use a certain lemma, check through mcp tools (or https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) to make sure the lemma exists. Else, write your own implementation of the lemma.

### Success Criteria

✅ All error and 'pure true' statements eliminated
✅ Clean compilation for entire file
✅ Each theorem verified individually before moving on

**Exploring project requirements**

I need to work on a Lean project called FloatSpec and implement some missing theorems in Core/${file}, although the user hasn't specified ${file}. It seems I should check Core/ and Core_Theorems_Comparison.md to find the missing theorems. The "ONE-BY-ONE" approach means I’ll tackle one theorem at a time. I have several tools available, including lean-lsp-mcp_* and browsermcp_*, but I might also consider using the shell for diagnostics. Let’s browse the files to identify the missing theorems.
[2025-09-16T02:44:35] codex

I’m going to scan the Core folder and the comparison markdown to identify the specific missing theorems, then tackle them one-by-one with builds after each.

**Finding missing theorems**

The comparison file is lengthy, and I need to identify which specific file in Core is missing theorems. The task directs me to introduce these theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}, but I’m not sure which file to focus on. It seems like the user might expect me to choose a particular file. I’ll need to examine the rest of the markdown to pinpoint what's missing. Let's dig in!

**Assessing missing theorems**

The comparison file contains a lot of missing theorems across various files. The task is to introduce these missing theorems into a specific file under "FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}", but I don’t know which file that is. I need to ask the user for clarification. It looks like I could start by picking one file, like FIX.lean or FLT.lean. The mapping lines indicate some inconsistencies, which might mean there are duplicates. I need to implement these missing theorems, leaving proofs empty and using the appropriate syntax.**Clarifying target files**

Many theorems in Lean Declarations end with "_spec," indicating they use hoare triple specifications. I need to check the "Zfast_div_eucl_spec" example in Zaux.lean to follow the right style. To move forward, I should choose a specific file to work on. Since the user’s variable ${file} might allow CLI settings, it feels unclear without an explicit selection. I think I should ask the user which Core file they’d like me to work on. While I wait for a response, I can look through the files to identify missing theorems.**Requesting file specification**

I think it’s best to ask the user to confirm which file to focus on. I wonder if they mentioned a file earlier in our conversation, but I can’t find that. So, I really need to ask. The instruction says we should keep progressing until resolved, but since the task involves a lot of work across files, it’s clear I need to focus on just one file. I’ll ask which file they prefer, suggesting candidates like Raux.lean, FIX.lean, or FLT.lean, since they seem to have numerous missing theorems.**Asking for the file**

I think it’s important to mention that I've read the documentation and I'm ready to proceed. Now, I need to ask the user which specific file they want me to work on. It's a straightforward step, but it ensures I'm aligned with their expectations. By clarifying this detail, I can effectively focus my efforts and address any necessary tasks related to the chosen file. Let's make that request clear and simple for the user.

Which Core file should I work on? Please specify the target `FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}` (e.g., `FIX.lean`, `FLT.lean`, `FLX.lean`, `FTZ.lean`, `Float_prop.lean`, `Raux.lean`). I’ll then import the missing theorems one-by-one, following the hoare-triple spec style used in that file, and run a build after each addition.
