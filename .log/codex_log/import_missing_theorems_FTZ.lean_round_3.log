## Task: Introduce Missing Theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}

## Scope

Introduce missing theorems in the file. You can find the record of missing theorems in file /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/FloatSpec/FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, which is generated by comparing the Coq and Lean versions of the file. For all the missing theorems in the file, find their corresponding Coq implementation in /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/flocq/src/Core and implement them in Lean, using the same name and similar syntax with existing theorems. Leave the proofs empty for now.

### Prerequisites

1. **Read documentation first:**
    - FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md - understand the overall pipeline
    - ./CLAUDE.md - focus on proof writing instructions and mvcgen info

### Core Requirements

### Theorem Importing Process

1. **Follow the Zfast_div_eucl_spec example** in Zaux.lean and other theorems in current file as your template
2. **ONE-BY-ONE approach is mandatory:**
    - Write ONE theorem
    - Use the hoare triple syntax (introduced in FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md and CLAUDE.md) to write the theorem
    - Check immediately with mcp tool or `lake build`
    - Fix any errors before proceeding to next theorem
    - Never batch multiple theorems without checking
3. After writing each theorem, check whether they are aligned with the Coq implementation. If so, mark them as complete in the record file.

### Before Writing Each Theorem

1. **Verify function implementation** - ensure the function body is correct
2. **Preserve syntax** - do NOT change hoare triple syntax unless absolutely necessary
    - Think multiple times before modifying specs or code body
    - If changes are needed, decompose complex specs rather than rewriting

### Compilation Verification

- **After EVERY theorem:** Run `mcp` (preferred) or `lake build xxx`
- **Definition of complete:** NO errors or 'pure true' statements
- **Never mark as complete if:**
    - Any errors or 'pure true' statements remain
    - Compilation returns errors
    - Sorry is allowed, but only as a placeholder for the proof


### Important Notes

- Use MCP tool instead of bash command to get diagnostic messages!
- Skip already-imported theorems!! There might be warnings be just leave them there!
- You can use exisiting (and proved) theorem to assist your spec writing. If a theorem is necessary but not introduced, you can turn to work on that first. The useful theorems might not be in the same file, but in the import list
- When you are trying to use a certain lemma, check through mcp tools (or https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) to make sure the lemma exists. Else, write your own implementation of the lemma.

### Success Criteria

✅ All error and 'pure true' statements eliminated
✅ Clean compilation for entire file
✅ Each theorem verified individually before moving on

**Clarifying implementation details**

I’m focusing on the FloatSpec repository and it seems there are some missing theorems that need adding in Core/${file}. The user didn’t specify which file, but I can check the record of these theorems in Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md. It looks like I need to explore the repo to find out what’s pending. I’ll review the comparison Markdown and figure out which Lean file needs lemma declarations with "sorry." It’s essential to clarify that before starting.**Exploring implementation parameters**

It looks like I need to figure out the right parameter to choose since the user might expect me to locate missing theorems across all Core files. However, the scope mentions “in the file,” so I should check the Markdown to identify sections for each file. I could start by implementing for the first file with missing theorems. I’ll follow the "one-by-one" approach, adding one lemma at a time and running the Lean MCP diagnostic tool for that file. Let’s explore the repo to get started!

I’m going to scan the comparison record and the Core folder to identify which file has missing theorems, then add them one-by-one with sorry proofs, checking each with Lean diagnostics.

**Correcting file path**

I noticed that the comparison listing for the file is listed as FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, which is from a single FloatSpec, not a doubled one. Oops, it was also pointed out that the directory I typed was incorrect. The correct path should actually be FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md. So, let's go ahead and open the file using this correct path!

# Core Theorems Comparison: Coq vs Lean (FloatSpec)

This document lists all theorem-like declarations in flocq/src/Core (*.v) and FloatSpec/src/Core (*.lean), grouped by file, and indicates for each Coq declaration whether a corresponding Lean theorem/lemma exists. Matching is based on exact/normalized/substr name matches and, when available, explicit Coq references in Lean comments.

**Analyzing missing theorems**

The comparison file is really large, and my task is to introduce missing theorems into a specific file in the FloatSpec directory. I need to identify a file in Core that lacks these theorems. The comparison shows that FIX.v has many "no match" instances, but that some theorems appear to be present under exact-names, which is confusing. I think I'll focus on a manageable file like FIX.lean, FLT.lean, or FLX.lean, starting with FIX.lean to check its style and existing theorems.

**Examining theorem implementation**

I see we shouldn't change existing elements because the success criteria state we need to eliminate all error and 'pure true' statements. It’s a bit conflicting, though, since there are many of those in the repository. The scope says to introduce missing theorems, which might mean they only want us to add new theorems rather than fix existing ones. I could focus on the file FLT.lean to implement a specific missing theorem, like using "Zfast_div_eucl_spec" in Zaux.lean as a template.

**Identifying missing theorems**

I see that the file has many theorems already, but there are stubs for missing ones related to FLT. I need to determine which file requires these introductions. Looking at the FIX mapping, some theorems show "no match," yet they are present in the file. The FLX mapping indicates many without matches as well. I’ll need to check the Raux.lean mapping, but the previous issues suggest that "Core_Theorems_Comparison.md" contains a vast amount of information, making it difficult to scan thoroughly. My task is to introduce the missing theorems noted in that file.**Deciding on theorem implementation**

It looks like I need to choose a specific file to add the missing theorems, and the "one-by-one" approach means I'll tackle them individually while checking Lean diagnostics. I see that the path to the Coq versions is located in "semester_6.5/flocq/src/Core." However, I first need to confirm which file in Lean to work on, since the user mentioned ${file}. I think it's best to propose using FTZ.lean to address the missing theorems listed as "no match" in the mapping. These includes: FLXN_format_FTZ, FTZ_format_generic, and others.**Exploring another file for missing theorems**

I'm considering that there might be another file with missing theorems: Round_generic.lean. It seems like a good idea to open it up and take a look. Since I've been focusing on FTZ.lean, this file might also need attention to find any missing theorems that need to be added. Let's see what I can discover there and how it fits into the overall task!

**Evaluating theorem implementations**

I'm looking at a large file with multiple theorems, and I need to identify any missing theorem declarations. The "FIX.v" mapping shows that "round_FIX_IZR" and "ulp_FIX" are present but marked as "sorry." This makes me wonder if all the missing ones were already included. I plan to check the "Float_prop.lean" mapping next, comparing it to the relevant section in "Float_prop.v" to see if I missed anything after FTZ.

**Considering theorem context**

I'm thinking maybe "succ" isn't defined in Lean yet. If I want to add a theorem that refers to "succ," I need to clarify both the name and context. I'm wondering whether it should be within Round_generic or Ulp. I feel I need to look for references to "pred" and "succ" to get a more comprehensive understanding. In general, it's important to ensure that everything is properly defined before proceeding.

**Exploring function definitions**

I'm looking into "succ" functions that exist in Coq but aren't defined in Lean. To clarify, if we want to add a theorem called "succ_FLX_1" referring to "succ," I need to figure out where "succ" is located in Lean. So, I should search through the Round_generic.lean file for any mentions of "succ." Let's see what pops up!

Quick check: I have the comparison record and core files open. Next step is to target a specific Core file and add missing theorems one-by-one with sorry proofs, checking Lean diagnostics after each.

To proceed precisely: which file under FloatSpec/src/Core should I work on? For example: FLX.lean, FLT.lean, FTZ.lean, FIX.lean, Generic_fmt.lean, Round_generic.lean, Round_pred.lean, Raux.lean, Float_prop.lean, etc.

Notes:
- FLX.lean: Missing Coq items include succ/eq_0_round_0/gt_0_round_gt_0/etc. Some (like succ_*) depend on definitions not present in Lean yet (no succ/pred in this repo), so best to start with ulp-related theorems (already partially stubbed).
- FLT.lean: Many missing Coq theorems are already stubbed with sorrys (e.g., generic_format_FLT_bpow, FLT_format_bpow, cexp_FLT_FLX, ulp_FLT_le, ulp_FLT_gt, ulp_FLT_exact_shift).
- FIX.lean and FTZ.lean: Core theorems present; some proofs are sorry but the declarations exist.

Once you confirm the target file, I’ll:
- Add exactly one missing theorem declaration (name and hoare-triple style) mirroring Coq.
- Run Lean diagnostics for that file.
- Iterate to the next missing theorem only after a clean check.
