## Task: Introduce Missing Theorems in FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}

## Scope

Introduce missing theorems in the file. You can find the record of missing theorems in file /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/FloatSpec/FloatSpec/src/Core/Core_Theorems_Comparison.md, which is generated by comparing the Coq and Lean versions of the file. For all the missing theorems in the file, find their corresponding Coq implementation in /Users/louhantao/Desktop/code/semester_6.5/flocq/src/Core and implement them in Lean, using the same name and similar syntax with existing theorems. Leave the proofs empty for now.

### Prerequisites

1. **Read documentation first:**
    - FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md - understand the overall pipeline
    - ./CLAUDE.md - focus on proof writing instructions and mvcgen info

### Core Requirements

### Theorem Importing Process

1. **Follow the Zfast_div_eucl_spec example** in Zaux.lean and other theorems in current file as your template
2. **ONE-BY-ONE approach is mandatory:**
    - Write ONE theorem
    - Use the hoare triple syntax (introduced in FloatSpec/PIPELINE.md and CLAUDE.md) to write the theorem
    - Check immediately with mcp tool or `lake build`
    - Fix any errors before proceeding to next theorem
    - Never batch multiple theorems without checking
3. After writing each theorem, check whether they are aligned with the Coq implementation. If so, mark them as complete in the record file.

### Before Writing Each Theorem

1. **Verify function implementation** - ensure the function body is correct
2. **Preserve syntax** - do NOT change hoare triple syntax unless absolutely necessary
    - Think multiple times before modifying specs or code body
    - If changes are needed, decompose complex specs rather than rewriting

### Compilation Verification

- **After EVERY theorem:** Run `mcp` (preferred) or `lake build xxx`
- **Definition of complete:** NO errors or 'pure true' statements
- **Never mark as complete if:**
    - Any errors or 'pure true' statements remain
    - Compilation returns errors
    - Sorry is allowed, but only as a placeholder for the proof


### Important Notes

- Use MCP tool instead of bash command to get diagnostic messages!
- Skip already-imported theorems!! There might be warnings be just leave them there!
- You can use exisiting (and proved) theorem to assist your spec writing. If a theorem is necessary but not introduced, you can turn to work on that first. The useful theorems might not be in the same file, but in the import list
- When you are trying to use a certain lemma, check through mcp tools (or https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) to make sure the lemma exists. Else, write your own implementation of the lemma.

### Success Criteria

✅ All error and 'pure true' statements eliminated
✅ Clean compilation for entire file
✅ Each theorem verified individually before moving on

I'll first inspect the comparison log and the Core source files to identify which specific Core file has missing theorems to implement. Then I'll open the target Lean file to add the first missing theorem skeleton and check diagnostics.

# Core Theorems Comparison: Coq vs Lean (FloatSpec)

This document lists all theorem-like declarations in flocq/src/Core (*.v) and FloatSpec/src/Core (*.lean), grouped by file, and indicates for each Coq declaration whether a corresponding Lean theorem/lemma exists. Matching is based on exact/normalized/substr name matches and, when available, explicit Coq references in Lean comments.

**Clarifying file selection**

The file in question is long, and I need to identify a specific Core file under FloatSpec/src/Core/${file}. The user mentioned ${file}, which leads me to think they expect us to confirm which file to target. They've asked for us to ensure our implementation always works with that file. It looks like I need to review the Lean files in FloatSpec/src/Core to find those with missing theorems. Let’s start by listing those files!

# FloatSpec Project Overview

You are a functional programmer working in Lean 4.

**Main Goal**: Create a provable Lean float implementation with formal verification. Use bootstrapping from feedback like compiler error messages to guide development.

## IMPORTANT: "Keep Going" Context

If you're told to "keep going" without context, you're likely working on:
1. **Float Implementation** - Developing provable floating-point arithmetic
2. **Specification Writing** - Creating formal specifications for float operations
3. **Test Writing** - Add more property-based tests using Plausible

## General Programming Philosophy

Programming is about onomastics (naming), composition (functoriality), and caching. Think conformally at every scale and across scales.

Build a pit of success: internal systems that grow as a whole outwards, never allowing the fallible external world to leak in except at boundaries. Meet the external world at well-defined interfaces.

When solving problems, write tooling/linters/auto-fixers to widen the pit of success. Use rigid compiler error messages and linter warnings to guide future users (**including** AI) toward correct solutions.

**Checking import style**

I'm trying to proof and check with a lean diagnostic. To do that, I need to open the target Lean file so I can see the import style and the existing theorems, particularly how they’re stated. I think opening FIX.lean will help me identify the pattern I'm looking for. It’s important to get this right so I can understand the structure better. Let's see what’s in that file!

**Clarifying theorem implementation**

I noticed that FLT has added some missing theorems, but many are still unaccounted for. The task says to introduce missing theorems in a specific file, likely either FLX.lean, FTZ.lean, or Float_prop.lean. I need to ask the user which file to target specifically. I also wonder if they want me to choose myself. If given that option, I'd lean towards FLT.lean due to the number of missing entries. Additionally, the instruction is to proceed "one-by-one," which means I'll need to focus on a single theorem skeleton at a time.**Investigating missing theorems**

I can implement one of the missing theorems from FLT, like cexp_FLT_FLX. This represents the exponent function mapping between FLT and FLX. There might also be a stub called FLT_exp_FLX_spec. The absence of certain entries like "cexp_FLT_FLX" and "generic_format_FLT_FLX" could indicate gaps between these two. The mapping shows "cexp_FLT_FLX → (no match)." I should look for the statement in the FLT.v Coq file. With network access ready, I'll navigate to the specified directory to inspect FLT.v for the relevant text.

**Checking missing theorems**

I’m looking at the Coq FLT.v file, which is pretty lengthy and filled with many theorems. Our task is to find and introduce any missing theorems into the Lean file. However, the user mentioned an unspecified file named `${file}`. It seems like I should check the FTZ.lean file for any theorems that might be missing in that context. There’s a bit to sort through, but I’ll figure it out!

**Clarifying missing theorems**

I’ve noticed that FTZ lacks several theorems from Coq. Currently, the FTZ.lean file includes only a few of them. The task requires me to "Introduce missing theorems" at a specific file path. So, I need to choose one file and implement the skeletons for each missing theorem, but first, I need to know which file to focus on. Let me ask the user for the specific file name before proceeding further.
[2025-09-15T18:49:57] codex

Quick check: I have the comparison log and Core files open. Many files (e.g., FLT.lean, FLX.lean, FTZ.lean, Float_prop.lean, Raux.lean, Zaux.lean) still list missing theorems.

Which specific Core file should I work on now (e.g., `FLT.lean`, `FLX.lean`, `FTZ.lean`, `Float_prop.lean`, `Raux.lean`, or `Zaux.lean`)? 

Once you pick the file, I’ll:
- Add exactly one missing theorem (matching the Coq name/signature) with the project’s hoare-triple spec style and a `sorry` proof.
- Run Lean diagnostics to ensure it compiles cleanly before moving to the next theorem.
