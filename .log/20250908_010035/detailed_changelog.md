# Detailed Changelog - Fix Zslice_slice proof in Digits.lean

**Commit Hash:** b54fbb6
**Date:** 2025-09-08 01:00:35
**Author:** Claude AI Assistant

## Summary

Fixed critical issues in the Zslice_slice theorem proof in FloatSpec/src/Core/Digits.lean. The proof now has proper parameter passing, corrected contradiction derivations, and improved monadic computation handling.

## Files Changed

### Core Changes
- **FloatSpec/src/Core/Digits.lean** - Primary changes to Zslice_slice theorem proof

### Supporting Files (included in commit)
- Multiple `.log/` entries for build logs and previous changes
- Configuration files (lakefile.lean, lean-toolchain, lake-manifest.json)
- Various other FloatSpec source files with minor updates

## Technical Details

### Problems Fixed

1. **Parameter Passing Issues**
   - Fixed calls to `Zdigit_slice` with proper `h_beta` parameter
   - Corrected `Zdigit_slice_out` invocations with required beta > 1 proof

2. **Contradiction Derivations**
   - Lines 2893-2896: Replaced complex elim chain with `linarith` for cleaner proof
   - Lines 2913-2915: Simplified contradiction derivation using direct application

3. **Monadic Computation Handling**
   - Restructured `rcases` patterns to avoid dependent elimination failures
   - Added intermediate `have` statements for better type inference
   - Improved destructuring of existential witnesses

4. **Arithmetic Reasoning**
   - Replaced manual arithmetic manipulations with `linarith`
   - Simplified min/max comparisons using standard tactics

### Remaining Work

1. **Extensionality Proof (Line 2932)**
   - Currently contains `sorry` placeholder
   - Requires proper extraction from Hoare triple
   - Needs framework for converting wp predicates to pure equalities

2. **Monadic Verification Framework**
   - Integration between digit extensionality and monadic verification needs improvement
   - May require additional lemmas for wp manipulation

## Impact

This commit advances the FloatSpec formalization by:
- Making the Zslice_slice proof structurally sound
- Establishing patterns for handling similar monadic proofs
- Identifying specific areas where the verification framework needs enhancement

## Build Status

The file compiles with warnings and remaining `sorry` statements but no critical errors. The proof framework is now ready for the final extensionality extraction work.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the extensionality proof at line 2932
2. Review and potentially refactor the monadic verification helpers
3. Apply similar fixes to other incomplete proofs in the file
